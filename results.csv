I don’t want to see like a curmudgeon because it’s still fun. I just think the long term health of the format is going to suffer. Perpetual seems exceedingly toxic for the game since it seems to almost exclusively punish graveyard or reanimator type decks. 

Likewise, seek and conjure are broken in ways. Primarily in what they could lead to, but I would say they are not too awful yet.

Finally: when will they update a banlist for historic brawl, if ever? Even from a few playhroughs it’s evident that the same cards from the last few years are still as broken as ever.

As far as paper Magic, I’ve played some commander (2p and 4p) and a lot of matches with Jumpstart packs. I’ve played a couple hundred ranked games on Arena in the past two weeks - Standard and as many drafts as I can afford. I enjoy the sealed formats most.

I’m definitely going to play the MID prerelease. I may also do a two headed giant MID event - they have draft and prerelease versions. 

The other event that really intrigued me was the mystery booster sealed. It’s $60, but the card pool looks very fun. I could play it up to 3x over the weekend.

&gt; Look at the top two cards of target opponent's library. Exile one of them face down and put the other on the bottom of that library. You may look at and play the exiled card for as long as it remains exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast that spell.

Pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong she isn't super powerful, but she is good and she feels like a commander and fits in with the draft/standard set she is in. 

In terms of standard she fits white weenie and human tribal potentially as one of many 3 drops, she has 4 toughness to trade/survive some things, she scales for later in the game, and she generates an extra body each turn creating the kind of clock you want in an aggro deck. She also helps fill out bodies to get coven triggers with.

In terms of EDH, there hasn't been a lot of legendaries that feel great as the token commanders which tokens are one of white's (other than equiment or mld/stax) moderately fleshed out strategies. [[Darien]] has an interesting ability and is probably more powerful when set up but he is 6 cmc. Our Cathar here comes out on turn three and does have an interesting theme of going wide means commander damage. She also contributes to that pay off by creating a good number of bodies for doing what those decks really want to be doing anyway which is swinging in. [[Idol of Oblivion]], [[Court of Grace]], [[Mentor of the Meek]], and [[Skullclamp]] can draw you plenty of of cards. Having a deck with some flexibility to go wide or tall in different situations could give the deck enough flexibility to have more legs in a game as building your board will build either win condition. She may be the default budget mono white human / soldier token commander. 

They made a Mono White Legendary that isn't so niche it has almost no support or requires jank combos to work (nothing wrong with working underpowered commander or jank decks but it shouldn't be the default of white... it should be an option). She joins together different themes and fuels her own strategy in a strong but not overpowered way. She actually feels like a commander.";hbx1ex3;1.0;0.0;1.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/pjjju6/mid_adeline_brilliant_cathar/hbx1ex3/;Empty;0.0;0.0;0.0;neutral;0.13;0.85;0.02

Ability 3 - Late game, brings back a flashback card for use once more, when you have more than enough mana.

It should either be 2BR, or each creature should only deal 2 damage. Otherwise, great use of templating to let people avoid the damage.

Lotus Eater is a really cool concept, but I'm not sure how much use it would see. I suppose it would be good in the sideboard of D&amp;T against LED fuckery, but that's about the only thing I can think of for it off the top of my head.

Silent Ruins is honestly something I wouldn't be surprised to see show up in the actual set itself. Or if not that, something that gives you mana of any color as long as it's nightbound. Great design.

Hobgoblin Guide is actually probably one of the more balanced R for a 2/2 with haste cards I've seen show up in /r/custommagic. There's a significant downside, and you give your opponent a lot of incremental value as they venture through the dungeon while you're swinging in. Great stuff.

Fblthp, Unwilling Explorer is an absolutely phenomenal alternate win-con, even if it's probably not printable under the current rules. But the idea of winning as long as you send him on an adventure through all the zones of the game is just so good, I can't help but love the card. 

Mmmmm, Fat Lotus. I wonder what kinda bullshit you could pull off with this if you ever actually cast it.

Decapitate is hysterical, 8.5/10 meme.

Decaying Lich is a really interesting concept. It basically says ""you now have to win the game without ever attacking, and you can't block either."" I don't know that it would be all that good, but it's such an elegant take on the decay mechanic applied to the player.

Spurn All Masters - I like the idea behind this card, but I think the numbers need a serious tweak as it's probably too strong at the moment. Against go-wide decks it's functionally a three-mana wrath in colours that aren't primary in wraths to begin with. Maybe better off colour-shifted to Boros?

Lotus Eater - End result is a nice ""fuck your mana-fixing"" card, but I'm not convinced it's templated correctly, and even if it is, it's *heavily* liable to misinterpretation despite the author's best efforts with reminder text.

Silent Ruins - Love this. Makes you work for your mana-fixing, and offers the opponent a way to turn it off through counterplay.

Hobgoblin Guide - I'm biased against venture, but the basic idea is fine if not the most creative.

Fblthp - No thanks. The design makes it impossible to use in anything other than EDH/Brawl, and it's a very uninteractive win condition that's probably too easy to break.

\---------

Fat Lotus - Yup, it's the millionth lotus/mox meme. Idk why people keep upvoting them.

Decapitate - One of those cards that could probably find its way into an actual Un-set, but everyone would forget about.

Decaying Lich - Well it's a hell of a lot better than \[\[Lich's Mirror\]\]. Giving the decayed downside to a player actually works pretty well as a downside, I think. Should probably be a creature rather than an enchantment though - as things stand, it shares the same problem as Mirror in that it does literally nothing unless you've actually lost the game.

Divide by Approximately Zero - Great joke, but I need to dust off my ""this should be white"" stamp as blue has no business giving cards infinite toughness.";hbxf1rj;7.0;0.0;7.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/pjludk/top_5_scoring_submissions_of_the_week_from/hbxf1rj/;positive;0.89;0.11;0.0;positive;1.0;0.0;0.0

Often it's some combination of punisher deal 6/kill two creatures for 3 mana, which is quite good, but punisher cards can have good rates and in environments where control is draw-go it does almost nothing. Still, a 3-mana ""wipe"" against midrange or token strategies is rough in some environments.
* Lotus Eater: Making the rules for this work isn't difficult, but I don't actually know if the distinction it makes is currently in the rules.  That said, it's a two-mana combo with [[Alpine Moon]] to lock any monocolored opponent out of the game and is just a generally bad tax piece otherwise except against treasure strategies, so I really don't like it at all. Also, does Magic use ""colour"" on English cards outside the US?
* Silent Ruins: The fact that this turns Day/Night on for 0 mana and can be used to turn the mechanic on and shift it to night the same turn means this would probably be a rare, if not a mythic. It also fundamentally messes with the design of the new werewolves to have zero-investment nighttime. Maybe the deck needs that kind of boost but we don't know that now.
* Hobgoblin Guide: I like the flavor, but in addition to not guaranteeing your opponent draws gas, this requires more effort from your opponent than [[Goblin Guide]] and I don't think we need a functional upgrade to an already playable card.
* Fblthp: This is a very cute alternate win condition (although you can't play it with [[The Grand Tour]]). It's incredibly clunky/weird and hard to make work, and also locks you into mono blue, but it's fun. Also there is only one shared Command Zone.
* Fat Lotus: Would probably be silver bordered, and they've done this joke better before.
* Decapitate: This would *also* probably be silver-border because the list of exceptions is so high that it becomes hard to reasonably track. Flavor-wise, it's weird that it kills hydras, and power-wise it actually hits most relevant creature types so it's still kinda good as a 2-mana instant.
* Decaying Lich: I mean, this is just a 4-mana ""gain 20 life"" card in any mono-black combo deck. Kind of weird, but a cute way to give a player decayed.
* Divide By Approximately Zero: This is a very cute silver-bordered card; near indestructibility for 2U and kill a creature for 3UB are both reasonable rates, so it's also printable.
