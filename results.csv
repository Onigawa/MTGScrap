Are bears in any color a thing now? I remember having a 2/2 for 1G or even 1W was fine, and some sets would print abilities on them. But now they print them for 1R or 1B without any drawbacks? Is that a regular thing now? What's the new mana cost to p/t curve look like?

I took a break from magic for a few months and just recently returned. I really like Historic (especially Historic Brawl) but I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around the new mechanics like seek, conjure, and especially perpetually…

I don’t want to see like a curmudgeon because it’s still fun. I just think the long term health of the format is going to suffer. Perpetual seems exceedingly toxic for the game since it seems to almost exclusively punish graveyard or reanimator type decks. 

Likewise, seek and conjure are broken in ways. Primarily in what they could lead to, but I would say they are not too awful yet.

Finally: when will they update a banlist for historic brawl, if ever? Even from a few playhroughs it’s evident that the same cards from the last few years are still as broken as ever.

We hope y’all can join us next Sunday, September 12th at 11:00AM for the first in person PPR since January 2020. 

We’re still taking things slow. They’ll be no out of town guests, and we’re splitting the day into two pods, but it’s in person and that’s something :D

Be sure to follow twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun and of course the VOD will hit our YouTube channel a few days after at youtube.com/lrrmtg";https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/phtgqm/innistrad_midnight_hunt_preprerelease/;phtgqm;405.0;1630768794.0;0.0;0.94;so excited i have always loved seeing these and have been in love with the channel since the first friday night episode speaking of wich any plans to bring it back?;hbr3dph;1.0;0.0;1.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/phtgqm/innistrad_midnight_hunt_preprerelease/hbr3dph/

Back in the day standard players could gawk at modern masters, but didn't have to play it.  And modern players could ignore all but 1 or 2 cards per set.  And limited players could ignore anything not in boosters.  And even edh wasn't solved yet so most decks could be happy playing bulk rares and tap lands.

But nowadays paper magic is dead in a lot of places because of covid, everyones tossing fetches and 2 cmc ramp and removal in their edh decks and every product is aimed at edh to some degree.

I know in my case I've tuned out most spoilers and new sets until my annual deck fix-up month.   And even then I've stopped upgrading a bunch of decks because they're good enough/not supposed to be powerful.";hbrft7u;11.0;0.0;11.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/pifwme/magic_the_consuming_spice8rack/hbrft7u/

These were the main products you could expect in any given Magic year several years ago, before the complaint of too many products became common. I'm leaving off various anthology products and From the Vault.

* January - Standard set
* February/March - Duel Deck
* April/May - Standard set
* June - Innovation Product
* July - Standard set
* August/September - Duel Deck
* September/October - Standard Set
* November - Commander decks

Next year we have (with my guesses for when they'll come out)

* January - Double Feature
* February - Kamigawa
* April - Unfinity or Legends
* May - Streets
* June - Unfinity or Legends
* July - Double Masters
* August/September - United
* October - Jump Start
* November - Brothers War

\+1 Major product with Double Feature, but seeing as how that is just different way to experience the two Innistrad sets it shouldn't take any mental bandwidth since unless they include some reprints from past Innistrad sets it will just be cards that were just released.

The major change is folding the commander decks into every set and Secret Lairs. IMO Secret Lairs are BY FAR the easiest products to ignore since unless you want all the cards or REALLY like the treatment they're doing you don't need to really think about them. The commander decks are where the real change is imo and that is the thing that really points to the quality being the ""issue"" and not the quantity. Those commander decks replaced the planeswalker decks which in turn had replaced the theme decks that they used to do. The number of products went up some with the change, but the amount we as a community care about the commander decks is MANY times great than how much we cared about the planeswalker decks. The same is true with going from Duel Decks to Master sets and stuff like Jump Start. Those are just more interesting and engaging products. This also dovetails into another important point, all the commander decks, the Master products and Jump Start, they let Wizards do tons of reprints. We DESPERATELY need reprints and the only way to get even close to the volume we need to keep prices under control is with not just product, but products that include more cards. The duel decks put out like 100 reprints, we get a similar amount with the commander decks that are just part of every set.";hbqex33;59.0;0.0;59.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/pifwme/magic_the_consuming_spice8rack/hbqex33/

I am quite happy with how much product is being released atm! As a person who drafts online and only buys singles (thank you Professor!), here's how I see the products today:

- The 4 standard sets each being a big set make for a more fun and varied drafting experience. 

- The innovation products we get beyond standard sets are a very welcome and needed place for reprints, which otherwise would be power level capped due to standard (and we remember how underwhelming core sets were in comparison to masters sets or legends sets). 

- Each set having commander decks (and now exclusive cards for set and collector's boosters) makes the commander format more accessible, both by providing an easy entryway and also by reprinting staples in thise decks. 

- The soft rotation of commander some people complain about I can understand, but I'm also in favor of that because it reduces the number of old non-reprintable staples, or at least provides similar power level options for a much lower price and thus reducing the barrier to the format. (This opinion is not applicable to modern, legacy and other non casual formats)

- The secret lairs, I completely ignore those, as they are totally unaffordable in my country.

We filthy casuals don't need to buy everything, and, for the mental health of the content creators, you shouldn't feel the need to review every single product being released, unless you are being paid for it.";hbplfkd;100.0;0.0;100.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/pifwme/magic_the_consuming_spice8rack/hbplfkd/

Nowadays there are people just playing commander and not touching standard. It makes sense from a monetary point of view that wotc makes products for them throughout the year, bringing forward an almost isolated thread of magic in parallel with the other threads: standard players, online only players, collectors only, new players to be converted with universes beyond, and even modern players now (with the modern only products that fly at a completely different height in terms of power level w.r.t. standard cards, increasing the isolation between modern and standard).

There are for sure players that try to play everything, or youtubers or even just curious people that try to keep up to date with everything, but they apparently they are not the majority, otherwise wotc wouldn't do what it's doing. I think they product policy is a clear sign that if you sum all the players and buyers from the separate streams of the various mtg sub-worlds, you obtain a much bigger number than players that play/are interested in/buy everything. 

I think asking them to decrease the quantity of products shows a point of view that might be too narrow and that is not too realistic on the situation. It's us, the customers, that have to understand that magic is becoming so big that it has to ""shard"" in order to scale up. This evolution is only natural for them with the continued increase of the player base. And people like me, who like to follow everything and read every single card, have to accept that it will become harder and harder to do so. Much like it would be hard to go to all places around the world of a restaurant chain that was once just a small beloved restaurant in your town.

I understand why it's such a struggle for youtubers that try to follow the game as a whole. Maybe an advice to some could be to stop thinking about magic as a game, but rather as a big franchise composed of many games and communities, and to concentrate only on one or few of them. I don't know if there's a general solution for the ones that want to keep up with everything. At least, I don't have it. 

Last reason why I think what they are doing is still reasonable and it's us that need to shift perspective rather than having to slow down: if you consider just the products for a single one of the sub-worlds mentioned above, you will notice that the amount of product isn't overwhelming, and it isn't bigger than the amount of product that standard players have always had every year since the beginning of time. Actually, if you think at the product that some of this sub-worlds used to get until recently in a year, for example commander, you would agree that what they got was very little compared to what others got, and now things are more equalized, and we should all cheer this, because everybody got enough of what they wanted.";hbs7gzn;1.0;0.0;1.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/pifwme/magic_the_consuming_spice8rack/hbs7gzn/

* Copy [[Basalt Monolith]]'s untap trigger to make your Mountains essentially act as Thran Dynamos

* [[Sensei's Divining Top]] allows you to cantrip for a red mana (copy the draw trigger and it will draw itself and another card)

* Become the manufacturing center of the world by copying [[Prototype Portal]] triggers on whatever dope egg you desire

Having access to a bunch of tutors for 3 mana each is definitely nice, but Overlord doesn’t have a cast trigger like TFS does, which makes it weaker against counterspells. Additionally, TFS gets the first Tutor more efficiently by casting/cascading into any 1 drop as long as your only 0 drop in the deck is a [[Profane Tutor]], which is often enough to assemble a [[Hibernation Sliver]]+ [[Morophon, the Boundless]] engine and win the game by casting a significant portion of your deck for free. Additionally, you don’t get completely hosed when your commander gets stolen from you- it’s not ideal, but at least they don’t suddenly get to take your entire board state. This probably isn’t the most accurate answer to the question, as TFS isn’t an extremely underrated commander, but I think it’s underrated enough to bring up here.;hbrykru;-2.0;0.0;-2.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/piqidf/what_is_in_your_opinion_the_most_underrated/hbrykru/

I play any hand with 2-5 lands and at least 1 of Nadaar, Yuan-ti Malison, or Triumphant Adventurer. Against aggro decks, I start with Mine of Phandelver to then transition over to Dungeon of the Mad Mage or clinch a good lead with Tomb of Annihilation. Otherwise, start with Mad Mage so you can line up some free Mind Flayers on the last room. I spend my control early to get the Venture ball rolling, but really just love this deck because of how FUN it is.

Please let me know what you think and whether you plan to play it! I'd really like to see more variety in Standard, so be the change you want to see. As a forever DM in 5E, it's just great to picture ol' Nadaar and some hired hands cutting through dungeons until they manage to bend Mind Flayers to \*their\* will.

I play any hand with 2-5 lands and at least 1 of Nadaar, Yuan-ti Malison, or Triumphant Adventurer. Against aggro decks, I start with Mine of Phandelver to then transition over to Dungeon of the Mad Mage or clinch a good lead with Tomb of Annihilation. Otherwise, start with Mad Mage so you can line up some free Mind Flayers on the last room. I spend my control early to get the Venture ball rolling, but really just love this deck because of how FUN it is.

Please let me know what you think and whether you plan to play it! I'd really like to see more variety in Standard, so be the change you want to see. As a forever DM in 5E, it's just great to picture ol' Nadaar and some hired hands cutting through dungeons until they manage to bend Mind Flayers to \*their\* will.

Gabe got himself into that mess. I’ve certainly lost on time more than I’ve won on time on MTGO and it’s frustrating to lose when you’re 5 seconds away from lethal, but in the end it’s just like chess- the clock is absolutely a part of the game.;hbri662;16.0;0.0;16.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/pipkqe/a_man_of_honor/hbri662/

Gab Nassif finds himself with a lethal on board next turn, if he can assemble it and click it through in 4 seconds. His opponent (Laplasjan) is basically dead, and seeing that he scoops rather than making Gab click it through (which he might not, this is a neolit software after all, and Gab is well known to sometimes experience internet issues).  
Now, some might say: that's a normal thing to do. Maybe yes, maybe no. Gab himself admits Laplasjan didn't have to do it, and thanks him for that. Clock is a very real win condition on Modo. If your opponent doesn't make it in time, it's none of your problem - they could've played faster.  
But what it is is a feels good sportsmanship moment. Enjoy.";hbr9b6j;19.0;0.0;19.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/pipkqe/a_man_of_honor/hbr9b6j/
