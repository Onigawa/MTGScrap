7;magicTCG;Need help combining sliver flavor texts for a project;"Title kind of says it all, but here’s some info

A friends birthday is coming up and I wanted to make them a custom token as a gift. They love slivers, and I thought it would be really cool to include some sliver flavor in the token. As someone who’s failed English twice in college, Im having a hard time combining these quotes (the flavor text from each sliver legend) in to something concise and eloquent, to the point where I’m not sure it’s even possible. I figured my best bet at this point would to ask some people who may be more qualified. 
The quotes are, 
“Her children are ever part of her.”
“Hidden within the clicking, chittering swarm is a unique mind, still young, but growing more aware as time passes.”
 “The end of evolution.” 
“This is the source, the line unbroken since the calamity that brought such monsters to our shores.” 

I understand this may not be the right place for this type of request, and if it’s not, I’d really appreciate being pointed in the right direction! Thanks for reading!";https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/pgb9iw/need_help_combining_sliver_flavor_texts_for_a/;0.57;1.0;0.0;1.0

16;magicTCG;An encounter as a newbie at my LGS;"Been playing MTG Arena since launch and just got into paper Magic. I was playing a casual Standard event at my LGS and on my last game against a regular, it seemed like everything was going fine. We were announcing all our steps and phases, clarifying rules interactions etc. Then all of a sudden, at the end of our last match, while I was digging for lethal, he got really upset, saying “Do you have lethal in your hand? Why don’t you just show it instead of wasting my time?”. I didn’t have it at the start of my turn and didn’t make any unnecessary plays besides resolving my cantrips (the cast triggers were necessary for lethal). He also had mana up so it wasn’t guaranteed. After packing up his cards, he wasn’t done, saying “no offence, but you need to play faster, if this was a tournament, you’d be penalised for slow play”. He then went on about having a long day, my deck and the state of Standard. I just apologised and left to chat with the other players, but it was disheartening and got me thinking.

1. I’m new to paper Magic.
2. This isn’t a tournament.
3. I was slowing the game down to explain what my cards did.
4. It’s not fair of him to take out his frustration on me.
5. It’s just a game.

While obviously the third layout became final option, it's interesting to look at the first two together with today's leak - the art for Arlinn (nightbound) and Wrenn are confirmed from their standard PW respectively, so the first two combined could potentially be the showcase of all four PW characters in MID.

As card number of borderless Wrenn is 278 and main set contains 277 cards, she's probably the only mono-color PW which makes Teferi likely WU again and the mysterious figure BX, if they try to balance the colors. Of course, as MID and VOW used to be one and Sorin more expected in VOW, there might be just three.

Or, Teferi bailed out like Ajani moved from Ixalan's placeholder to AER and we had second Huatli instead. But if he did show up, I wonder he'll be designed to manipulate day/night (tho WU should already be good at that lol).";https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/pg7opg/revisiting_booster_art_placeholders_before/;0.86;28.0;0.0;28.0
18;magicTCG;Damage Dealt.;"I’ve recently built UR Giants for standard and am curious as to how damage is dealt in regards to Calamity Bearer and trample? For example; equipping Calamity Bearer with Embercleave.

If Calamity Bearer is blocked by, say, a 2/1 and before damage - equip with Embercleave, Calamity Bearer becomes a 4/5 Trample, Double Strike and any damage is deals to a creature or player is doubled.

I believe I am still allocating 4 damage to the blocker which gets doubled during damage step. But where I am confused is - Does Calamity Bearer deal 1 damage to the 1 toughness blocker, doubling it to 2 damage and 3 damage tramples over, doubling to 6 damage, then second strike deals 4 damage to opponent doubling to 8?";https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/pg7n6h/damage_dealt/;0.5;0.0;0.0;0.0
19;magicTCG;How to 'optimally' make full token sets when considering double-sided tokens?;"This is the dumbest problem but it's driving me a little nuts. I recently came into a lot of bulk tokens for very cheap. We're talking like 4000-5000+ tokens. Mostly from ~5-8 total sets or so, so there's 20+ of most tokens, but a few I only have 1-3 copies of.

My plan was to sort them all out and make full sets of them and sell them. There's not a ton of $$ to be made there but the act of sorting itself is relaxing and fun for me and I can buy more EDH staples with the extra cash so eh - it worked for me

**But here's the thing - almost all the tokens are two-sided, and it feels like some crazy Logic or Algebra problem trying to figure out the optimal token face to use to make the highest number of full token sets!**

Example: I have a billion copies of the ""Copy"" token so my first thought was obviously half of those should be flipped over to whatever is on the other side. But most of the reverse sides are Saporlings, which are themselves a fairly common token. And I have Saporlings in a separate pile that themselves have different things on the back...

Compounding this optimization puzzle, half the Commander 21 tokens I have actually have a Strixhaven token, complete with a separate card number and everything, on the reverse. So I feel like to optimally complete as many sets as possible I also need to have sorted and counted my Strixhaven token pile alongside my C21 token pile in order to ""balance"" them as evenly as possible...

Is there any resource that lists all the A/B token possibilities? Is there a resource that lists which token is the ""common"" side, per set, so I can figure out which can more likely be flipped over and brought into balance?";https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/pg7mf8/how_to_optimally_make_full_token_sets_when/;0.45;0.0;0.0;0.0
