5;magicTCG;Unconfortable at long time LGS FNM;"Hi everybody, I'm looking for some advice about the people at my LGS FNM. I have been playing at the store for years now but recently I have been feeling uncomfortable playing there due to some of the players. Keep in mind that this is is a pretty competitive LGS. Most recently at FNM I beat my opponent 2 - 0 and I tried to offer him some confort in saying that it was a bad match up, I was on watoos UW control deck while he was on rhino's, and that he got unlucky.  

However instead of taking it well, he starts saying that it's not a bad matchup and he should have won both games and that I had to get lucky top decking both games for 4 turns straight not to die. I tried to say that I had more answers in hand to defend myself but he just talks over me and interject his own false reality. This isn't the first time that he has gotten this salty, he has already driven out one of my friends from playing at this LGS, and during one of the games he yells at me for tapping the wrong land even though I had the mana. Later on he goes on to talk loudly to his crowd in the middle of the room about how I got lucky ignoring some of the fact, like I had 4 cards in hand or that I vantressed multiple times or my deck is literally designed to beat his. It felt WORSE to win than to lose. 

At the same FNM I hear one of the older players in the crowd that the first guy was apart of loudly say that he could never win the match because his opponent's deck just beat his so it didn't matter. It is not limited to just these two guys but around 4 or so players that have this terrible attitude of ""I am better than you so I should win"" and when they do lose, they try to take the wins away from their opponents. I HATE playing against them because it feels bad to win, you didn't earn it / you got lucky / I couldn't ever win, and it feels bad to lose. I tried talking to the organizer but he just looked at me like he knew about issues. 

Looking back, I can recognize many events where these people don't lose gracefully, ruining the mood. However on the good side, I like the rest of the patrons very much, it is a great space, the staff is cool, and it is the only store within 20mi of my house so I don't want to leave. What do I do?
